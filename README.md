###Purpose:
Every been tired of modern programming languages with all their fancy type inference and generics? Or perhaps you like working closer to the metal. Or maybe you just forgot how to code a quicksort and this is the first google hit you've come across. Regardless this is a very simple and unoptimized implementation of a quicksort for integers using MASM32 and the Irvine32 library.
